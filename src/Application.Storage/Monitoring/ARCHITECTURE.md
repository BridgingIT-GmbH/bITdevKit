# File Monitoring System - Architecture

## System Overview
The File Monitoring System provides robust file change monitoring across various storage types. Changes can be detected through two distinct mechanisms: real-time watching and on-demand scanning. Events from both sources flow through a common processing pipeline, ensuring consistent handling regardless of the detection method. The system is designed for reliability, extensibility, and clear operational boundaries.

## Architectural Component Overview
The system is composed of several key component groups that work together to provide comprehensive file monitoring capabilities. Each group has specific responsibilities and clear interfaces with other components, ensuring a modular and maintainable architecture.

## Core Components

### Monitoring Service
The Monitoring Service acts as the central orchestrator of the system, managing all aspects of file monitoring and event processing. It provides comprehensive control and insight into the system's operation through various interfaces and events. The service maintains independence between locations while ensuring consistent processing and reliable operation.

Key responsibilities include:
- Location lifecycle management and control through pause, resume, and restart operations
- Event queue handling with rate-limited processing
- Processing coordination across multiple locations
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Operational controls for runtime configuration
- Custom event publishing for external integration

### Change Detection
The system employs two fundamentally different approaches to change detection, each serving specific use cases while ensuring consistent event generation. This dual approach provides flexibility in how changes are detected while maintaining uniform event processing.

#### Watchers (Real-time)
File system watchers provide immediate change detection through system notifications:
- File system event-based detection requiring no active polling
- Direct event generation without state comparison
- Immediate notification of changes
- Optional per location with default enabled state

#### Scanners (On-demand)
Scanners actively inspect the file system and compare with known state:
- Systematic traversal of configured locations
- State comparison with previously stored events
- Change detection through configured strategy
- Event generation for detected differences
- Support for startup and on-demand scanning

### Processing Pipeline
The event processing pipeline ensures reliable and controlled handling of all detected changes. It implements rate limiting and sequential processing to maintain system stability while providing clear tracking and error handling capabilities.

Core features:
- In-memory queue with unlimited capacity
- Rate-limited processing with configurable thresholds
- Strictly sequential event processing
- Optional processor retry policies
- Comprehensive status tracking
- Event correlation throughout the flow

### Storage Layer
The storage layer focuses solely on maintaining file event history and processing results. It provides efficient access to historical data while maintaining clear boundaries around what is persisted.

Responsibilities:
- File event persistence with full state
- Processing result storage
- Efficient event lookup by id or path
- Historical event tracking
- Clear storage boundaries

### Operational Features
The system provides comprehensive operational features through standard .NET interfaces, ensuring easy integration with existing monitoring and management systems.

Key features:
- Native .NET meters for performance metrics
- Standard health checks for monitoring
- Rich event publication for external integration
- Comprehensive operational control interfaces

## Event Flows

### Real-time Watching Flow
The watcher-based detection provides immediate notification of file system changes:

    participant FS as FileSystem
    participant W as Watcher
    participant MS as MonitoringService
    participant BL as Blacklist
    participant Q as Queue
    participant P as Processors
    participant S as Storage

    FS->>W: File Change Event
    W->>MS: FileEventArgs
    MS->>MS: Create FileEvent
    MS->>BL: Apply Blacklist
    
    alt Not Blacklisted
        BL->>Q: Enqueue FileEvent
        Note over MS: Raise FileEventReceived
        
        loop Rate Limited Processing
            Q->>P: Process FileEvent
            Note over MS: Raise BeforeProcessing
            
            alt Processing Success
                P->>S: Store Completed Status
            else Processing Failed
                P->>S: Store Failed Status
            end
            
            Note over MS: Raise AfterProcessing
        end
    end
```

### Scanning Flow
The scanner provides systematic change detection through state comparison:

        alt Change Detected
            CD->>MS: Create FileEvent
            MS->>BL: Apply Blacklist
            
            alt Not Blacklisted

                Note over MS: Raise FileEventReceived
                
                loop Rate Limited Processing
                    Q->>P: Process FileEvent
                    Note over MS: Raise BeforeProcessing
                    
                    alt Processing Success
                        P->>S: Store Completed Status
                    else Processing Failed
                        P->>S: Store Failed Status
                    end
                    
                    Note over MS: Raise AfterProcessing
                end
            end
        end
    end
