# File Monitoring System - Overview

## Introduction
The File Monitoring System provides comprehensive file change detection and processing capabilities across various storage types. It combines real-time monitoring with on-demand scanning to ensure no changes are missed, while maintaining efficient resource usage and clear operational boundaries. The system is designed for reliability, extensibility, and clear operational visibility through native .NET monitoring capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

### Change Detection
The system employs two complementary approaches to file change detection. Real-time watchers provide immediate notification of changes through filesystem events, requiring no active polling or state comparison. This is complemented by on-demand scanning capability that systematically compares filesystem state with previously recorded events, ensuring comprehensive change detection even after system downtime.

Change detection can use either timestamp-based comparison (default) or checksum-based verification, configurable per location. This flexibility allows for balancing performance against accuracy requirements for different monitoring scenarios.

### Event Processing
All detected changes flow through a common processing pipeline, ensuring consistent handling regardless of their source. The system uses an in-memory queue with rate-limited processing to maintain stable operation under varying loads. Events are processed sequentially through configurable processor chains, with optional retry policies available per processor.

The processing pipeline maintains clear event correlation throughout the flow, with comprehensive status tracking and error handling. Each processor can enhance the event with additional information, which is persisted with the event for later reference.

### Operational Features
The system integrates with standard .NET monitoring capabilities, providing metrics through System.Diagnostics.Metrics and health checks through the standard health check system. This enables seamless integration with existing monitoring infrastructure while maintaining clear boundaries around core functionality.

Rich event publication enables external systems to react to various system occurrences, from file detection through processing completion. The monitoring service provides comprehensive control and insight into system operation through clear interfaces.

### Use Cases
The File Monitoring System can be applied in various scenarios where reliable and efficient file change detection and processing are critical. Here are some potential use cases:
