# File Monitoring System - Design Summary

## Core Design Philosophy
The File Monitoring System is built around the principle of reliable file change detection and processing, with clear operational boundaries and comprehensive monitoring capabilities. It combines real-time monitoring with on-demand scanning while maintaining consistent processing behavior and clear resource management.

## Fundamental Approaches

### Change Detection
The system implements two distinct but complementary approaches to change detection. Real-time watchers provide immediate notification of changes through filesystem events, requiring no active polling or state comparison. This is augmented by scanner-based detection that systematically compares filesystem state with previously recorded events, ensuring no changes are missed even during system downtime.

Each location employs exactly one change detection strategy - either timestamp-based (default) or checksum-based comparison. This clear strategy choice per location maintains system predictability while allowing for different accuracy requirements across locations. The strategy pattern enables future extension with additional detection methods while maintaining clear implementation boundaries.

### Event Processing Model
At the heart of the system lies a carefully designed event processing pipeline. All detected changes, regardless of their source, flow through a common processing chain. The system employs an in-memory queue with distinct rate limiting for both enqueueing and dequeuing operations, ensuring stable operation under varying loads.

Events are processed sequentially through configured processor chains, with optional retry policies available per processor. This sequential processing model ensures predictable resource usage and clear error boundaries, while the optional retry policies enable resilience against transient failures.

### Operational Integration
The system integrates with standard .NET monitoring capabilities through System.Diagnostics.Metrics and the health check system. This enables seamless integration with existing monitoring infrastructure while maintaining clear boundaries around core functionality. Rich event publication enables external systems to react to various system occurrences, from file detection through processing completion.
