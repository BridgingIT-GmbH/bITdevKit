# File Monitoring System - Architecture

[TOC]

> The File Monitoring System provides robust file change monitoring across various storage types, including traditional file shares and cloud storage systems like Azure Blob Storage. Changes can be detected through two distinct mechanisms: real-time watching (where supported) and on-demand scanning. Events from both sources flow through a common processing pipeline, with extensible behaviors providing monitoring and insight capabilities. The system is designed for reliability, extensibility, and clear operational boundaries.

## Architectural Component Overview
The system is composed of several key component groups that work together to provide comprehensive file monitoring capabilities. Each group has specific responsibilities and clear interfaces with other components, ensuring a modular and maintainable architecture.

```

The `Storage Watcher (SW)` is optional and configurable per location. By default, it is enabled if supported by the provider (`SupportsRealTimeWatching` is `true`) and not disabled via `UseOnDemandOnly`. The `Storage Provider (SP)` abstracts both file shares and cloud storage, using `FileMetadata` for file information and supporting scalable listing operations with continuation tokens.

## Core Components

### Monitoring Service
The Monitoring Service acts as the central orchestrator of the system, managing all aspects of file monitoring and event processing. It provides comprehensive control and insight into the system's operation through various interfaces and events. The service maintains independence between locations while ensuring consistent processing and reliable operation.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Location lifecycle management and control through pause, resume, and restart operations
- Event queue handling with rate-limited processing
- Processing coordination across multiple locations
- Behavior system coordination
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Operational controls for runtime configuration, including enabling/disabling real-time watching based on provider support and configuration

### Behavior System
The behavior system provides extensible monitoring and insight capabilities through a plug-in architecture. Behaviors receive notifications about scan operations and can provide various monitoring, logging, and analysis capabilities.

**Key Aspects:**
- Plug-in architecture for monitoring operations
- Rich context sharing between behaviors
- Clear lifecycle events (start, detection, completion)
- Built-in behaviors for common needs
- Custom behavior support

#### ScanContext
The `ScanContext` provides rich contextual information about ongoing scan operations:
- Unique scan identifier for correlation
- Location and timing information
- Progress tracking and state management
- Error collection and handling
- Performance metrics collection
- Extensible properties for behavior communication

### Change Detection
The system employs two fundamentally different approaches to change detection, each serving specific use cases while ensuring consistent event generation. This dual approach provides flexibility in how changes are detected while maintaining uniform event processing.

#### Watchers (Real-time)
File system watchers provide immediate change detection through system notifications:
- File system event-based detection requiring no active polling
- Direct event generation without state comparison
- Immediate notification of changes
- Optional per location, enabled by default if the storage providerâ€™s `SupportsRealTimeWatching` is `true`, configurable via the `UseOnDemandOnly` option to disable real-time watching and restrict to on-demand scanning

#### Scanners (On-demand)
Scanners actively inspect the storage system and compare with known state:
- Systematic traversal of configured locations, using scalable listing with continuation tokens where necessary
- State comparison with previously stored events
- Change detection through configured strategy using `FileMetadata`
- Event generation for detected differences
- Support for startup and on-demand scanning
- Integration with behavior system for progress tracking

### Processing Pipeline
The event processing pipeline ensures reliable and controlled handling of all detected changes. It implements rate limiting and sequential processing to maintain system stability while providing clear tracking and error handling capabilities.

**Core Features:**
- In-memory queue with unlimited capacity
- Rate-limited processing with configurable thresholds
- Strictly sequential event processing
- Optional processor retry policies
- Comprehensive status tracking
- Event correlation throughout the flow

### Storage Layer
The storage layer focuses solely on maintaining file event history and processing results. It provides efficient access to historical data while maintaining clear boundaries around what is persisted.

**Responsibilities:**
- File event persistence with full state
- Processing result storage
- Efficient event lookup by id or path
- Historical event tracking
- Clear storage boundaries

### Operational Features
The system provides comprehensive operational features through standard .NET interfaces, ensuring easy integration with existing monitoring and management systems.

**Key Features:**
- Behavior-based monitoring and metrics
- Standard health checks for monitoring
- Rich event publication for external integration
- Comprehensive operational control interfaces

## Event Flows

### Real-time Watching Flow
The watcher-based detection provides immediate notification of file system changes where supported by the storage provider:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FS as StorageSystem
    participant W as Watcher
    participant MS as MonitoringService
    participant BL as Blacklist
    participant Q as Queue
    participant P as Processors
    participant S as Storage

    FS->>W: File Change Event
    W->>MS: FileEventArgs
    MS->>MS: Create FileEvent
    MS->>BL: Apply Blacklist

    alt Not Blacklisted
        BL->>Q: Enqueue FileEvent
        Note over MS: Raise FileEventReceived

        loop Rate Limited Processing
            Q->>P: Process FileEvent
            Note over MS: Raise BeforeProcessing

            alt Processing Success
                P->>S: Store Completed Status
            else Processing Failed
                P->>S: Store Failed Status
            end

            Note over MS: Raise AfterProcessing
        end
    end
```

**Note**: This flow occurs only for locations where the `Storage Provider` supports real-time watching (`SupportsRealTimeWatching` is `true`) and `UseOnDemandOnly` is not set.

### Scanning Flow with Behaviors
The scanner provides systematic change detection with behavior integration, adaptable to both file shares and cloud storage:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MS as MonitoringService
    participant SC as Scanner
    participant BH as Behaviors
    participant SP as StorageProvider
    participant CD as ChangeDetector
    participant ST as FileEventStore
    participant BL as Blacklist
    participant Q as Queue
    participant P as Processors
    participant S as Storage

    MS->>MS: Create ScanContext
    MS->>BH: OnScanStarted

    loop For Each File
        SC->>SP: ListFilesAsync (with continuation)
        SC->>SP: Get FileMetadata
        SC->>ST: Get Last FileEvent
        SC->>CD: Check For Changes

        alt Change Detected
            CD->>MS: Create FileEvent
            MS->>BH: OnFileDetected
            MS->>BL: Apply Blacklist

            alt Not Blacklisted
                BL->>Q: Enqueue FileEvent

                loop Rate Limited Processing
                    Q->>P: Process FileEvent

                    alt Processing Success
                        P->>S: Store Completed Status
                    else Processing Failed
                        P->>S: Store Failed Status
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end

    MS->>BH: OnScanCompleted
```

**Note**: The scanner uses `ListFilesAsync` with continuation tokens to handle large-scale cloud storage listings efficiently, while functioning seamlessly for local file systems without pagination.

## Appendix A: Built-in Behaviors

### LoggingBehavior
The `LoggingBehavior` provides structured logging for scan operations:

```csharp
public class LoggingBehavior : IMonitoringBehavior
{
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingBehavior> logger;

    public LoggingBehavior(ILogger<LoggingBehavior> logger)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    public void OnScanStarted(ScanContext context)
    {
        using var scope = logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["CorrelationId"] = context.ScanId,
            ["LocationName"] = context.LocationName
        });

        logger.LogInformation(
            "Started scanning location: {LocationName}. Start time: {StartTime}. Scan ID: {ScanId}",
            context.LocationName,
            context.StartTime,
            context.ScanId);
    }

    public void OnFileDetected(ScanContext context, FileEvent fileEvent)
    {
        using var scope = logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["CorrelationId"] = context.ScanId,
            ["LocationName"] = context.LocationName
        });

        logger.LogDebug(
            "Found change in {Path} of type {EventType}. Total changes: {TotalChanges}",
            fileEvent.FilePath,
            fileEvent.EventType,
            context.DetectedChanges);
    }

    public void OnScanCompleted(ScanContext context, TimeSpan duration)
    {
        using var scope = logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["CorrelationId"] = context.ScanId,
            ["LocationName"] = context.LocationName
        });

        logger.LogInformation(
            "Scan completed. Location: {LocationName}, Duration: {Duration}, Total changes: {TotalChanges}, Scan ID: {ScanId}",
            context.LocationName,
            duration,
            context.DetectedChanges,
            context.ScanId);
    }
}
```

### MetricsBehavior
The `MetricsBehavior` collects performance metrics during scan operations:

```csharp
public class MetricsBehavior : IMonitoringBehavior
{
    private readonly Meter meter;
    private readonly Counter<long> scanStarted;
    private readonly Counter<long> changesDetected;
    private readonly Histogram<double> scanDuration;
    private readonly ObservableGauge<int> activeScanCount;
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<Guid, DateTime> activeScanTimes = new();

    public MetricsBehavior()
    {
        meter = new Meter("FileMonitoring");
        scanStarted = meter.CreateCounter<long>("file_monitoring.scans.started");
        changesDetected = meter.CreateCounter<long>("file_monitoring.changes.detected");
        scanDuration = meter.CreateHistogram<double>("file_monitoring.scan.duration", "ms");
        activeScanCount = meter.CreateObservableGauge<int>(
            "file_monitoring.scans.active",
            () => activeScanTimes.Count);
    }

    public void OnScanStarted(ScanContext context)
    {
        scanStarted.Add(1);
        activeScanTimes.TryAdd(context.ScanId, DateTime.UtcNow);

        meter.CreateObservableGauge(
            $"file_monitoring.scan.progress.{context.ScanId}",
            () => context.GetProgress());
    }

    public void OnFileDetected(ScanContext context, FileEvent fileEvent)
    {
        changesDetected.Add(1);
    }

    public void OnScanCompleted(ScanContext context, TimeSpan duration)
    {
        scanDuration.Record(duration.TotalMilliseconds);
        activeScanTimes.TryRemove(context.ScanId, out _);

        meter.RemoveInstrument($"file_monitoring.scan.progress.{context.ScanId}");
    }
}
```

Through these architectural decisions and clear boundaries, the system provides robust file monitoring capabilities across diverse storage types, maintaining reliability, extensibility, and operational excellence. The behavior system ensures comprehensive monitoring and analysis capabilities that can be extended for specific needs.
